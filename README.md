# Speed Testing Project with Remix

Welcome to the Speed Testing Project with Remix! This project focuses on evaluating the speed and efficiency of Remix as a frontend library through various tests and optimizations.

## Introduction

In this project, we are exploring the performance metrics of Remix, a modern JavaScript library for building web applications. Remix provides a robust framework for creating fast, dynamic, and interactive user interfaces. Our goal is to analyze how Remix handles different scenarios and complexities, particularly focusing on its build times and runtime performance.

## Initial Build Speed

The initial build speed of this project is **39ms**, measured by fetching data from the PokeAPI for the first 20 PokÃ©mon. This serves as our baseline measurement for evaluating the efficiency of Remix. As we progress, we'll introduce more features and complexities to observe how Remix adapts and maintains its performance.

Stay tuned for updates as we delve deeper into optimizing and testing the performance of Remix in various scenarios.
